# 👋 Hi there, I'm Gaven Pearl

I approach programming as both an art and a science—each line of code is like a sentence in a logical story.
Through that story, well-designed and functional software takes shape—where structure and creativity work together to bring ideas to life.

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong preference for backend development, where I enjoy designing systems, managing data flow, and solving complex problems beneath the surface. I work confidently with technologies like **C#**, the **.NET framework**, **Java**, and **ReactJS**, and I often turn to **Python** for simpler personal projects or quick prototyping.

I am consistently focused on solving real-world and personal challenges through practical technical solutions that are efficient, effective, and grounded in logical principles. My dream is to hone my skills to one day build an automated "off-grid" house, where systems like power, garden management and water are managed through solutions I’ve developed, allowing me to implement my own innovations in my everyday life.
